# dotfiles

Teddy's *nix configuration files

Install these dotfiles into your home directory by cloning this repository then running `$ ./install.sh` from the project root.

Warning: the `install.sh` script will overwrite dotfiles currently in your home directory. Make sure you read and understand `install.sh` before running it, and make sure there is nothing in your current home directory dotfiles that you want to keep before you run this script.
